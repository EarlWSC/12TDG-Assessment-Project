    <p>The World RallyX Championship is a Short form, high intensity racing series held on mixed surface circuits (tarmac, gravel or dirt.) It features head-to-head races with standing starts, jumps and extreme and legal contact. Combining rally car tech with side by side circuit racing.
<br>
        Since 2022, WRX has turned fully electric, named the RX1e class. These electric beasts produce 680 horsepower and an instant 880Nm of torque. But back then before the electric switch, the internal combustion engines of the RX1’s and Supercars were as powerful and better sounding than what we have now.

      <h1 id="selectiontitle">Handbrake Pull @ 160kph taking the Lead of the Race!</h1>
      <p>As the lights turn green, the rallycross race begins. The Black Monster and Italian RX1e's have a good start off the line. As they jumped off the crest, the Orange Kempower of Kevin Eriksson's RX1e gained a massive speed advantage as he sent it late on the brakes into Turn 1. Not only did he send it late, but he sent it pulling his handbrakes, forcing the rear of the car to move towards the next corner. This handbrake pull was risky, but the reward was high and it was shown as he takes P1 uncontended.</p>

      <h1 id="selectiontitle">Marvelous Last to First Overtake with a calculated pull</h1>
      <p>Kevin Eriksson found himself to be 4th on the 6 lap race. Though a short race, Kevin Eriksson proved that it only takes 1 corner to take back his rightful first place position. As the 3 other cars in front of Kevin duke it out for who takes control of the 1st corner by sending themselves to the inside, Kevin Eriksson had other plans. He took the outside line where nobody would expect him, performed a handbrake pull and waved the 3 other cars goodbye as he took first place position.</p>

        <p>The 2nd to Last Lap of the Final Race of RallyX 2020, Kristoffersson had set the final Joker Lap of the race and was expected to come out behind of Ekstrom. And it was so but the pressure was on Ekstrom as he had to defend against Kristoffersson for the final lap. As Kristoffersson closed in and sniffed for the overtake, the checkered flag was seen waving and the weight on Ekstrom's back was lifted as he takes the win at Holjes. Kristoffersson was close, only 0.197s behind Ekstrom.</p>
