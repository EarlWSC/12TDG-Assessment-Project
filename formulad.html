    <p>Formula Drift is the top-tier professional drifting series with countries have their own drift battles under the name. It blends motorsport skill with car control magic. It focuses on close head-to-head tandem battles, and external forces judging the style, angle, line, proximity and rather how they perform their drift run.
        Drivers compete in heavily modified RWD cars with V8 engines, turbo or naturally aspirated. It pushes over 1,000 Horsepower running on special drift tires to maximize the smoke and slide of their drifts.
        Tandem battles feature a lead vs chase run format and the winner advances based on the highest score or through a “One More Time!” Tiebreaker.

        <p>The 2022 Silverstone Grand Prix had one of the most chaotic race starts as of date. As the lights went out, 20 cars scrambled to gain position and advantage. Amongst the chaos, an unsuspecting George Russell was rear-ended by Sauber driver Zhou Guanyu. The way he hit Georges Mercedes caused the car to spin and flip vertically. He was sliding across the tarmac at 200km/h, upside down. Fortunately, he came out of the car unscathed and unharmed.</p>

        <p>The 2024 Canadian Grand Prix experienced a heavy amount of rain, making all drivers weary of the slippery surface. A brave Alex Albon driving for Williams took this opportunity to pull off an impossible overtake. Before the last corner, he overtook Ricciardo in the Vcarb and sneakily slid into the blindspot of Ocon. After the checkered flag, he finished ahead of both Ricciardo and Ocon due to his incredible bravery to pull off such an overtake.</p>

        <p>As Lewis Hamilton was leaving the pits, he was caught by the charging redbull of Max Verstappen, in which they were side by side into the first Chicane in Monza 2021. As they took the corner, both didn’t want to give up position. So eager to keep the position, Max Verstappen took a sausage kerb that caused the car to erratically jump into the air and, being so close to Lewis, landed on top of his Mercedes. They both didn’t finish the race, with previous Mclaren driver Ricciardo taking the win.</p>

        <p>As the Racing Point of Ocon was attacking Renault Driver Hulkenberg, unbeknownst to them, a charging Lewis Hamilton was fast approaching. Needing to make a decision, he took the deep inside line and joined the braking point of Turn 1 with 2 other cars side by side. In the end, Lewis Hamilton came out on top, with Ocon following close behind and Hulkenberg distancing away.</p>
