    <p>Formula Drift is the top-tier professional drifting series with countries have their own drift battles under the name. It blends motorsport skill with car control magic. It focuses on close head-to-head tandem battles, and external forces judging the style, angle, line, proximity and rather how they perform their drift run.
        Drivers compete in heavily modified RWD cars with V8 engines, turbo or naturally aspirated. It pushes over 1,000 Horsepower running on special drift tires to maximize the smoke and slide of their drifts.
        Tandem battles feature a lead vs chase run format and the winner advances based on the highest score or through a “One More Time!” Tiebreaker.

      <p>
Jump on board as we closely view the battle between 2 American Drift Master Contenders. Watch how close these drifters get to one another and to the wall while maintaining precision of their angle, speed and drift style. Watch as the tire smoke drowns their view out, trusting everything but their eyes as they feel and trust the way their car moves in tandem.

      <h1 id="selectiontitle">Quote on Quote, The Best Drift Battle in History</h1>
      <p>The First Battle starts with the #130 Turquoise R34 driven by James Deane leading the way as the #43 Blue R34 driven by Pawel Borkowski chases after him. The Drift led by James was nothing short of extraordinary with incredible speed, angle and style that would make you second guess if he was really going to hit the wall or not. Pawel was not letting his chances go as he closed in as much as possible to James.
Into the Second Battle, the roles are switched as Pawel leads the way with James following close behind. Same as before - the chase car not letting go of the slack as Pawel tries to lose him. Watch to the end to find out who came out victorious!
