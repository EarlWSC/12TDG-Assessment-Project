    <p>Formula 1 is the highest class of international motorsport racing. It is an Open-wheel Single Seater racing series that focuses on producing a car to its absolute limits; the fastest racing series known to Earth, driven by the bravest and fearful racing drivers you'll come across.
        Formula 1 Cars are made of carbon fiber body with a single centered open cockpit where the driver seats during the race. It has a 1.6L V6 Turbocharged Hybrid Engine, capable of generating 950 Horsepower (710 KiloWatt), enabling these types of cars to reach speeds up to 375 km/h. Their unique shape improves aerodynamics and downforce of the cars, enabling them to take corners at much higher speeds than normal road cars.

      <p>The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the final race of the season, starting from 2012 to present times. <br>
      In 2021, the most heated rivalry of Formula 1 History, between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton, was to be decided on the final race of the season. Both tied with 392.5 Points, whoever wins will take the 2021 World Championship. For the first 52 laps, Lewis Hamilton kept a 20 second lead on Max Verstappen. <br>
      He was on track to be the 8th World Champion of Formula 1, but Lap 53 struck a safety car. This made all the drivers close up as a pack, which included Max Verstappen to be only a couple of tenths away from Lewis Hamilton. The final lap struck, and Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen went racing for the final time. Max Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton on Turn 5 and leading the rest of the pack then. This made Max Verstappen a first time world champion and Lewis Hamilton losing his chance to be the first 8th World Champion.</p>

      <p>The 2024 Austrian Grand Prix was the first race of the season to encounter hard racing between 2 title contenders; Max Verstappen and Lando Norris. <br>
      Lando Norris has been chasing Max Verstappen for 5 laps since Lap 57 and has been pressuring him to make a mistake and take the lead away from Max. On Lap 63, the boiling point of the heated chase had reached its climax and we saw a terrific divebomb from Lando Norris. <br>
      Max Verstappen, not giving away the position, fights back and accidentally causes a collision. This collision was powerful enough for both drivers to cause a tyre puncture on both their cars. In the end, George Russell took the lead and won, with Max Verstappen finishing 7th and Lando Norris retiring his car.

        <p>The 2022 Silverstone Grand Prix had one of the most chaotic race starts as of date. As the lights went out, 20 cars scrambled to gain position and advantage. Amongst the chaos, an unsuspecting George Russell was rear-ended by Sauber driver Zhou Guanyu. The way he hit Georges Mercedes caused the car to spin and flip vertically. He was sliding across the tarmac at 200km/h, upside down. Fortunately, he came out of the car unscathed and unharmed.</p>

        <p>The 2024 Canadian Grand Prix experienced a heavy amount of rain, making all drivers weary of the slippery surface. A brave Alex Albon driving for Williams took this opportunity to pull off an impossible overtake. Before the last corner, he overtook Ricciardo in the Vcarb and sneakily slid into the blindspot of Ocon. After the checkered flag, he finished ahead of both Ricciardo and Ocon due to his incredible bravery to pull off such an overtake.</p>

        <p>As Lewis Hamilton was leaving the pits, he was caught by the charging redbull of Max Verstappen, in which they were side by side into the first Chicane in Monza 2021. As they took the corner, both didn’t want to give up position. So eager to keep the position, Max Verstappen took a sausage kerb that caused the car to erratically jump into the air and, being so close to Lewis, landed on top of his Mercedes. They both didn’t finish the race, with previous Mclaren driver Ricciardo taking the win.</p>

        <p>As the Racing Point of Ocon was attacking Renault Driver Hulkenberg, unbeknownst to them, a charging Lewis Hamilton was fast approaching. Needing to make a decision, he took the deep inside line and joined the braking point of Turn 1 with 2 other cars side by side. In the end, Lewis Hamilton came out on top, with Ocon following close behind and Hulkenberg distancing away.</p>
