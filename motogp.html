    <p>MotoGP is the premier class of motorcycle road racing, sanctioned by the FIM. It features the top of the class, fastest and most technologically advanced motorcycles that have been created. These motorcycles, though small and timid, are capable of incredible speeds of 360km/h.
        MotoGP bikes are prototypes and are not bound from any production based bikes. With a 1,000cc four-stroke engine producing 250 horsepower, a shocking dry weight of under 160kg, these motorcycles can show an incredible side of dangerous and intense racing. Elbows, knees and shoulders scraping the ground below through winding corners and fast straights. It requires the most bravery, balance and precision to withstand this sport.

        <p>#125 Treston Morrison had lost control and fell off his bike. Treston, being in the middle of the apex, was run over by another rider - #47 Avery Dreher. Dreher had nowhere to go after Morrison went down as Treston was unfortunately parked and crashed in the middle of a blind downward corner. Treston’s body could’ve been split in half here with the weight, but thanks to updated safety regulations, no serious injuries were found.
