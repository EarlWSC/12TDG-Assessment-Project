    <p>NHRA is the highest tier of drag racing. It showcases the fastest-acceleration machines ever. The Top Class, “Top Fuel,” can accelerate from 0-530km/h in under 3.7 seconds across a 305 meter drag-strip!
Events are held in an elimination style: 2 cars race per round, first to cross the line advances. It’s a sport of precision launches, engine brutality and massive flames.

      <p>The First time a 4-way Drag Race happened was used with the Funny Car Classes. It was an exciting moment as fans were unsure and curious when Charlotte Drag Strip facilitated a 4-wide Drag strip. The Funny Car class although not as fast as Top Fuel, these dragsters can still hit speeds of 330mph (531kmh) with exhausts shooting out flames of horsepower.
